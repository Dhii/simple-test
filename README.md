A simple, lightweight, standards-compliant, object-oriented testing framework, made for use with PHP.

### Features
- Use directly from PHP, no need for CLI wrappers;
- Can produce text output similar to that of other CLI testing frameworks;
- A granular approach to how or which tests to add;
- A queriable result report that exposes granular details of test resutls;
- Simple assertions, providing an extensible entry point for limitless complexity;
- No need to depend on any concrete implementation - see project dependencies;
- Loosely-coupled code via traditional dependency injection.
- Clear separation of concerns;
- Clear public API and implementation thereof.

### Planned
- Add more assertions, perhaps OOP style - via callable classes;
- Add and test support for mocking frameworks;
- Make a stable release;
- Re-factor using features of PHP 5.6 and make a separate stable release.
